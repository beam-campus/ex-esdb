### Triggers will obtain Emitter Pids from :pg (Process Groups)

Experimentation with :khepri's trigger model has shown that it is advised to use as few dependencies as possible, when defining the trigger functions. This is because :khepri uses :horus to decompile such functions and build a separate module. For this reason, we limit the dependencies for these trigger functions to :pg (Process Groups), which is an :erlang native module that allows for inter-process communication.

### Subscriptions will be managed via a registry.

`subscribe_to` and `unsubscribe` will interact with the :subscriptions branch of the store, but instead of storing the pid of the subscriber, the subscriber will be stored in a registry.

### Each Store will contain separate branches for Streams, Subscriptions, and Projections

- `:streams` will be used to store the events that are being read from and written to the store.
- `:subscriptions` will be used to store the subscription information of so-called `Persistent Subscriptions`.
- `:projections` can best be thought of as stored procedures that are used to transform the events in the `Streams` into a different format or to enrich the streams with secondary or derived events, to name a few possible use cases.

Thus:

```mono
:khepri
  |
  +-:manage_orders
      |
      +-:streams
      |
      +-:subscriptions
      |
      +-:projections
```
