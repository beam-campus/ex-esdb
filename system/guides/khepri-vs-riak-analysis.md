# Khepri vs Riak: Analysis for ExESDB

## Executive Summary

**Recommendation: Stick with Khepri**

Replacing Khepri with Riak for ExESDB would be a significant architectural change with questionable benefits. Khepri provides better embedded deployment, BEAM-native integration, and is specifically designed for modern distributed systems with Raft consensus. Riak, while proven, is older technology with embedded deployment challenges and lacks the tight BEAM integration that ExESDB currently enjoys.

## Detailed Analysis

### Current Khepri Integration

ExESDB is tightly integrated with Khepri:

1. **Embedded Deployment**: Khepri runs embedded within the ExESDB application
   - Started directly via `:khepri.start(data_dir, store_id, timeout)`
   - No separate server process or external dependencies
   - Configuration through ExESDB's own config system

2. **BEAM-Native Integration**:
   - Uses Ra (Raft) for consensus, built specifically for BEAM
   - Leverages Erlang's distributed capabilities naturally
   - Tight integration with OTP supervision trees
   - Built-in support for BEAM clustering patterns

3. **Modern Architecture**:
   - Raft consensus algorithm (more modern than Dynamo-style)
   - Designed for strong consistency by default
   - Better suited for event sourcing use cases

### Riak Deployment Model

**Riak Core (Embedded)**:
- Riak Core is theoretically embeddable
- Requires significant configuration and setup
- More complex than Khepri's simple embedded model
- Heavyweight for embedded use cases

**Riak KV (Standalone)**:
- Traditionally deployed as separate cluster
- Not designed for embedded deployment
- Requires external process management
- Complex operational overhead

### Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | Khepri | Riak |
|--------|--------|------|
| **Embedded Deployment** | ✅ Native, simple | ❌ Complex, heavyweight |
| **BEAM Integration** | ✅ Purpose-built for BEAM | ⚠️ BEAM-based but not optimized |
| **Event Store Fit** | ✅ Designed for consistency | ⚠️ AP-focused, may need tuning |
| **Operational Complexity** | ✅ Simple, OTP-integrated | ❌ Complex, separate ops |
| **Consensus Algorithm** | ✅ Raft (modern) | ⚠️ Dynamo-style (eventual consistency) |
| **Multi-tenant Support** | ✅ Built-in via store_id | ⚠️ Requires custom implementation |
| **Community/Maintenance** | ✅ Active (RabbitMQ team) | ❌ Declining, TI Tokyo maintenance |
| **Learning Curve** | ✅ Moderate | ❌ Steep |

### Technical Challenges with Riak Migration

#### 1. Embedded Deployment Complexity

**Khepri (Current)**:
```elixir
# Simple embedded start
case :khepri.start(data_dir, store_id, timeout) do
  {:ok, store} -> # Ready to use
end
```

**Riak (Hypothetical)**:
```elixir
# Would require complex setup
riak_core_config = [
  # Extensive configuration required
  ring_state_dir: data_dir,
  platform_data_dir: data_dir,
  handoff_port: find_free_port(),
  # Many more configuration options...
]

# Start multiple processes
{:ok, _} = :riak_core.start_link(riak_core_config)
{:ok, _} = :riak_kv.start_link()
# Additional setup for routing, vnodes, etc.
```

#### 2. Multi-Store Support

**Khepri**: Natural multi-store support with different `store_id` values
**Riak**: Would require custom bucket/namespace management or multiple Riak instances

#### 3. Consistency Model Mismatch

**Event Sourcing Requirements**:
- Strong consistency for event ordering
- Linearizable reads for projections
- Atomic multi-event transactions

**Khepri**: Provides strong consistency via Raft
**Riak**: Eventual consistency model, would need significant tuning

#### 4. Operational Overhead

**Khepri**: 
- Embedded in application
- Single configuration surface
- OTP supervision handles everything

**Riak**:
- Separate operational concerns
- Ring management complexity
- Handoff and rebalancing overhead
- Separate monitoring and metrics

### Migration Effort Analysis

**Code Changes Required**:
1. **Storage Layer**: Complete rewrite of `ExESDB.Store`
2. **Clustering**: Rework `ExESDB.KhepriCluster` to use Riak's cluster model
3. **Configuration**: Extensive changes to config management
4. **Supervision**: Restructure supervision trees for Riak processes
5. **Operations**: New deployment, monitoring, and maintenance procedures

**Estimated Effort**: 3-6 months of full-time development

### Riak's Current State

**Concerns**:
- Basho (original company) went out of business in 2017
- Now maintained by TI Tokyo with limited resources
- Community has largely moved to other solutions
- No significant new features or improvements
- Documentation and ecosystem support declining

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Most organizations have migrated away from Riak
- Modern alternatives: CockroachDB, FoundationDB, TiKV
- For BEAM specifically: Khepri, Partisan, or custom Ra clusters

### Performance Considerations

**Khepri**:
- Optimized for BEAM runtime
- Lower latency for small-medium datasets
- Simpler performance tuning
- Better integration with BEAM telemetry

**Riak**:
- Designed for massive scale (100s of nodes)
- Higher latency due to complexity
- Complex performance tuning required
- Overkill for most ExESDB use cases

### Benefits of Staying with Khepri

1. **Simplicity**: Embedded deployment model is much simpler
2. **BEAM-Native**: Purpose-built for BEAM ecosystems
3. **Active Development**: Maintained by RabbitMQ team
4. **Event Store Fit**: Designed for consistency, perfect for event sourcing
5. **Multi-Store Support**: Natural support for multiple stores
6. **Modern Architecture**: Raft consensus vs. old Dynamo-style
7. **Lower Operational Overhead**: No separate cluster to manage

### When Riak Might Make Sense

**Hypothetical Scenarios** (not applicable to ExESDB):
- Massive scale requirements (1000+ nodes)
- Eventual consistency is acceptable
- Already have Riak operational expertise
- Need specific Riak features (like MapReduce)

## Conclusion

**Recommendation: Continue with Khepri**

The migration from Khepri to Riak would be a step backward for ExESDB:

1. **Architectural Fit**: Khepri is purpose-built for BEAM and event sourcing
2. **Operational Simplicity**: Embedded deployment is much simpler than managing separate Riak clusters
3. **Development Velocity**: Significant development effort with questionable benefits
4. **Future-Proofing**: Khepri has active development, Riak is in maintenance mode

**Alternative Recommendations**:

If there are specific issues with Khepri that prompted this question:
1. **Performance**: Profile and optimize Khepri usage first
2. **Scalability**: Consider Khepri clustering improvements
3. **Features**: Evaluate if missing features can be built on top of Khepri

**Focus Areas for ExESDB**:
1. Optimize current Khepri integration
2. Improve multi-store configuration support
3. Enhance monitoring and observability
4. Build ExESDB-specific features on top of Khepri

The current Khepri-based architecture is well-suited for ExESDB's requirements and should be maintained and enhanced rather than replaced.
