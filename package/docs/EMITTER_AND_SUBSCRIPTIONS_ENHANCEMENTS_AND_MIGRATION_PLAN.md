# Emitter and Subscriptions Enhancements and Migration Plan

## Findings and Proposals

### Current Architecture:
1. **Event-Driven Architecture:** Utilizes Khepri triggers for subscription lifecycle management.
2. **Emitter and Subscription Management:** Emitters start/stop based on subscription events. Leader nodes handle emitter pools.
3. **Health Monitoring:** Basic system checks are in place to monitor processes and resource utilization.
4. **Cluster Management:** Leadership and membership are managed, but may need stronger consistency and event replay mechanisms.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Redundancy and Recovery:**
   - Implement event replay for missed subscription events during leader changes.
   - Enhance redundancy to ensure pool operations are idempotent and recoverable.

2. **Monitoring and Health Checks:**
   - Extend health checks to include detailed emitter and subscription health status.
   - Introduce automatic recovery actions based on health check results.

3. **Fault Tolerance:**
   - Use circuit breakers for emitter and subscription registrations to prevent excessive retries.
   - Implement persistent state verification and cleanup for potential data corruption.

4. **Performance Enhancements:**
   - Optimize resource usage by adjusting emitter pool sizes dynamically.
   - Enhance logging for better visibility and easier debugging.

5. **Robustness in Leader Transitions:**
   - Ensure seamless emitter and subscription handover during leader changes.
   - Automate processes to detect and resolve stale subscriptions that could be left behind.

### Proposed Migration Plan:

1. **Infrastructure Enhancements:**
   - Implement a **Subscription Health Monitor** to regularly check emitter and subscription statuses.
   - Develop an **Event Replay Mechanism** to handle missed events during leader changes.
   - Use **Circuit Breakers** to manage retry logic for system operations.

2. **Code Modifications:**
   - Update existing modules to incorporate new monitoring and replay mechanisms.
   - Integrate Health Monitor into existing supervision trees for automated issue detection.
   - Refactor emitter and subscription mechanisms to support replay and enhanced consistency.

3. **Testing Strategy:**
   - Implement comprehensive **unit tests** to cover new functionalities.
   - Develop **integration tests** simulating leader changes and system recoveries.
   - Perform **load testing** to measure performance impact and optimize configurations.

4. **Deployment Plan:**
   - Roll out changes first in a **staging environment** to identify potential issues.
   - Maintain **backward compatibility** to avoid disruptions in service during migration.
   - Gradually migrate the production environment, ensuring system stability at each stage.

5. **Documentation:**
   - Maintain updated documentation on new enhancements and changes.
   - Document the process for handling emitter and subscription anomalies.
   - Outline recovery procedures and automated responses tested in staging.

## Implementation Progress

### âœ… **Completed:**

#### 1. Subscription Health Monitoring (Phase 1)
**Files Created/Modified:**
- `./package/lib/ex_esdb/subscription_health_monitor.ex` - Complete health monitoring system
- `./package/test/ex_esdb/subscription_health_monitor_test.exs` - Comprehensive test suite
- `./package/lib/ex_esdb/notification_system.ex` - Integrated health monitor into system

**Features Implemented:**
- **Stale Subscription Detection:** Identifies subscriptions with dead subscriber processes
- **Orphaned Pool Detection:** Finds emitter pools without corresponding subscriptions
- **Missing Pool Detection:** Identifies subscriptions that should have emitter pools but don't
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Configurable cleanup of detected issues with retry logic
- **Health Reports:** Detailed reporting with timestamps and issue summaries
- **Leadership Awareness:** Only performs certain operations on leader nodes
- **Configurable Monitoring:** Adjustable check intervals and retry policies

**API Functions:**
- `SubscriptionHealthMonitor.health_check/1` - Immediate health check
- `SubscriptionHealthMonitor.last_health_report/1` - Get cached health report
- `SubscriptionHealthMonitor.set_cleanup_enabled/2` - Enable/disable automatic cleanup
- `SubscriptionHealthMonitor.force_cleanup/2` - Manual cleanup of specific issues

**Integration:**
- Successfully integrated into `ExESDB.NotificationSystem` supervision tree
- Starts automatically with each store instance
- Runs periodic health checks (default: every 60 seconds)
- Logs health status and issues for observability

**Testing:**
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration test with supervision tree
- Stale subscription detection logic verification
- Health report structure validation
- Configuration and state management tests

### ðŸš§ **Next Steps:**

#### 2. Event Replay Mechanism (Phase 2)
**Planned Implementation:**

#### 3. Circuit Breakers and Fault Tolerance (Phase 3)
**Planned Implementation:**
- Create `ExESDB.RegistrationCircuitBreaker` module
- Integrate circuit breakers into critical registration paths
- Add exponential backoff and retry logic
- Monitor and alert on repeated failures

#### 4. Enhanced Monitoring Integration (Phase 4)
**Planned Implementation:**
- Extend existing `ExESDB.Monitoring.HealthChecker` to include subscription health
- Add metrics collection for subscription issues
- Create alerting mechanisms for critical failures
- Dashboard integration for health visualization
